# Transitive and Intransitive verbs

- Trong tiếng Nhật, nhiều khi ta thấy một động từ có 2 loại khác nhau (「落とす」,「落ちる」), đây được coi là động từ chuyển tiếp và nội động từ
- Sự khác biệt:
>[!text]
>**Động từ chuyển tiếp** là hành động được thực hiện bởi 1 tác nhân, còn **nội động từ** là hành động xảy ra mà không có tác nhân trực tiếp

- Ví dụ:
>ボールが落ちた。 (intransitive)
>The ball dropped.

>ボールを落とす。(transitive)
>I dropped the ball.

>出る。【でる】(intransitive)
>leave, exit, come out

>出す。【だす】(transitive)
>take out, bring out

- Lưu ý: Chú ý sử dụng đúng trợ từ cho từng loại động từ

# Cách phân biệt

**「ある」、「する」**

- 「ある」: tồn tại (be)
- Bạn không thể tồn tại một thứ gì khác, bạn chỉ có thể tồn tại trong bản thân mình
>[!text]
>Về cơ bản,「ある」là nguồn gốc của nội động từ

- 「する」: làm (do)
- Cũng như「ある」, bạn không thể chỉ "làm" không, mà phải **làm một việc gì đó**
>[!text]
>「する」là nguồn gốc của động từ chuyển tiếp


- Thường thì động từ chuyển tiếp sẽ đi với trợ từ「を」, còn nội động từ sẽ đi với trợ từ「が」
- Ví dụ:
>電気==を==消す。
>(I) turn off the lights.
>
>Trong câu với động từ chuyển tiếp này「電気」là tân ngữ được chủ ngữ (tôi) tác động bởi động từ「消える」, vì thế nên phải đi với trợ từ「を」


>電気==が==消える。
>The light goes out.
>
>Trong câu với nội động từ,「電気」lúc này là chủ ngữ nên sẽ phải đi với trợ từ「が」

### Law 1

And the first of those laws is that if one of a pair ends in す, that is going to be the other-move word, always.

Why? Because that す is related to "する".

So, in the example we gave before, "出る / 出す", "出る" means "come out" and "出す", which ends in す, is the other-move verb – that's the one that means "take (something else) out".

In "負ける / 負かす", we know that the other-move verb, the verb that means "make (someone else) lose" is "負かす" because it ends in す.

And an awful lot of those す pairs actually make that particular transformation, える to す.

But not always.

  

In some cases... we have, for example, "落ちる", which means "fall", and "落とす", which means "drop".

They have the same kanji; they are a pair, they don't have that regular える to す ending, but "落とす" still has す on the end, so we still know that that is the other-move partner of the pair.

### Law 2

Now, the second rule is that where one of a pair ends in any of the a-stem + る , so it ends in the sound ある, that is going to be the self-move partner of the pair.

Why? Because that ある is related to "ある", the mother of all self-move verbs.

The usual pattern here is える to ある.

  

We already looked at that in the last lesson, where we have "あがる", which means "rise up/get up", and "あげる", which means "raise (something) up".

It is very often used to mean to "give (something) upward (to another person)".

So we have "あがる" and "あげる", and we know that the self-move partner of the pair is "あがる" because it ends in ある.

The usual form here is える to ある, but again it doesn't have to be.

There are other cases, such as "包む", which means "wrap", and "包まる", which means "be wrapped", but again it doesn't matter because we know that the one ending in ある is always going to be the self-move partner of the pair.

### Law 3

Now, the third law is that if we take any regular verb ending in う sound (as they all do) and change it to the え-row and add る , which means that it ends in える, that flips a self-move word to an other-move word or an other-move word to a self-move word.

The problem is that we don't know in every case know from the structure which way the word will be flipped.

  

However, this is not as difficult as it seems, because first of all this is not a large number of verbs – the majority are covered by the first two rules – and of this group of う to える flips, the majority is む to める.

### Law 4

And める is – I would call this an honorary member of the す family.

Or you could say that む to める is the honorary fourth law.

Whichever way you put it, in む to める, める is always the other-move partner of the pair.

And indeed as you get more experienced in Japanese, you will get to feel that める-ending verbs have a する-like other-move feeling to them.

  

And this really is all you need to know if you're beginning with self-move / other-move verbs, because this covers really the vast majority of all the pairs you're going to encounter.

So don't feel that you have to learn the rest of this lesson.

You can come back to it later whenever you want to.

But I'm going to just complete it, partly so that you have all the information you might need for the future and partly because it's going to give us more insight into how self-move and other-move really works.

  

So the next thing to know is that as well as む / める, which is the big one, there are also other honorary members of the す family and these are: ぶ to べる. 

べる is always the other-move version (and ぶ and む are very close in Japanese; you may know "さびしい / さみしい" and other words like that, where you can just use ぶ or む in the same word, so める and -べる naturally are both honorary members of the す family).

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2bx56p99p3Sn1cRvH9CX3MrIUJ5mJIX_bpl-3QFAR9I_VsmBufy8_LT8l3utXgE_JD00sWub6ToN1xukkT_ldXjo3klj7lo7HPieUP1cgVlPSqMxXEbePcMjG_TjL9Y0Ucqls2k2r6e5ZkV5OO3pGg)

And also -つ / てる – the てる is always the other-move pair.

So in the end we really have very few wild cards in this pack.

  

The only ones that we really can't tell which way they are going is く and ぐ, to ける and げる, う to える, and those る-ending verbs that don't fit either of the first two laws.

So these are in fact the only exceptions where you really can't tell structurally which way they are going.
